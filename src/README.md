<!-- To help maximize the impact of your README and improve usability for users, we propose the following loose structure:

**BEFORE YOU BEGIN**
- Ensure all links are absolute URLs so that they will work when the README is displayed within Grafana and Grafana.com
- Be inspired âœ¨
  - [grafana-polystat-panel](https://github.com/grafana/grafana-polystat-panel)
  - [volkovlabs-variable-panel](https://github.com/volkovlabs/volkovlabs-variable-panel)

**ADD SOME BADGES**

Badges convey useful information at a glance for users whether in the Catalog or viewing the source code. You can use the generator on [Shields.io](https://shields.io/badges/dynamic-json-badge) together with the Grafana.com API
to create dynamic badges that update automatically when you publish a new version to the marketplace.

- For the logo field use 'grafana'.
- Examples (label: query)
  - Downloads: $.downloads
  - Catalog Version: $.version
  - Grafana Dependency: $.grafanaDependency
  - Signature Type: $.versionSignatureType

Full example: ![Dynamic JSON Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/dynamic/json?logo=grafana&query=$.version&url=https://grafana.com/api/plugins/grafana-polystat-panel&label=Marketplace&prefix=v&color=F47A20)

Consider other [badges](https://shields.io/badges) as you feel appropriate for your project.

## Overview / Introduction
Provide one or more paragraphs as an introduction to your plugin to help users understand why they should use it.

Consider including screenshots:
- in [plugin.json](https://grafana.com/developers/plugin-tools/reference-plugin-json#info) include them as relative links.
- in the README ensure they are absolute URLs.

## Requirements
List any requirements or dependencies they may need to run the plugin.

## Getting Started
Provide a quick start on how to configure and use the plugin.

## Documentation
If your project has dedicated documentation available for users, provide links here. For help in following Grafana's style recommendations for technical documentation, refer to our [Writer's Toolkit](https://grafana.com/docs/writers-toolkit/).

## Contributing
Do you want folks to contribute to the plugin or provide feedback through specific means? If so, tell them how!
